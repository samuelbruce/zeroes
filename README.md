# ZEROES
---
A MediaMonkey Addon for removing (or even adding) leading zeroes from (or to) numerical fields.

Why do this? Sometimes I find myself adding tracks or albums to my MediaMonkey library from sources that add leading zeroes to the track number by default. And I don't like this! Removing them manually was a drag so eventually I got around to making this addon. Perhaps someone else will find it useful!
